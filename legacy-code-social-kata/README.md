### Rules of refactoring

- You can not change production code if it's not covered by tests
- You are only allowed to use the refactoring tools of your IDE
in the production code

### Use case

- you need to be logged in to access any content
- User can see the posts of friends

### Goal

- Make the code easy to change

### Tips

- Add tests to the code
- use code coverage to make sure you have tests for all cases
and code branches
- once you achieve ~100% code coverage you can start changing
the production code
- refactor the tests
